# `DuplicateModule` 错误

## 原因

This error occurs when two modules have the same name.

## 修复

- Make sure your module names are correct.
- Check to make sure you do not have any duplicate modules in your dependencies.
- If you are passing input files to the compiler using a wildcard, make sure it is not
  including any files twice.
